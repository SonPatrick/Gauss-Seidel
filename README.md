# Gauss-Seidel
 An iterative method to solve a linear system of equations.
 
In numerical linear algebra, the Gaussâ€“Seidel method, also known as the Liebmann method or the method of successive displacement, is an iterative method used to solve a linear system of equations. It is named after the German mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Philipp Ludwig von Seidel, and is similar to the Jacobi method. Though it can be applied to any matrix with non-zero elements on the diagonals, convergence is only guaranteed if the matrix is either diagonally dominant, or symmetric and positive definite.
 
This Java Program provides a simple linear equation solver using Gauss-Seidel iterative method for 3 variable Linear Systems. 


##The source code is well commented. :)
